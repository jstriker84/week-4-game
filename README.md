# week-4-game

## Overview

This is the Crystal Collector game built using jQuery. Here's how the app works:

 * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
 
 * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
 
 * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
 
    * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
    
    * When they do click one, the player's score is updated.
    
 * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
 
 * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
 
 * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
